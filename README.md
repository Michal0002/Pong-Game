## Multiplayer mode
Multiplayer mode for two players adds an exciting element of competition. Developed using Python and libraries such as pandas and pygame, this game offers engaging gameplay and intuitive controls. Additionally, the application utilizes sound effects, triggering upon ball bounce or when a point is scored by hitting the ball out of bounds. Are you ready for a solo showdown or do you want to challenge your friend?
